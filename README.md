# Wasteless
WasteLess is a mobile app that helps people share what they no longer need — from clothes and food to books and tools — with someone nearby who does.  Built with React Native (Expo) for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend (containerized with Docker), and Supabase for authentication and file storage.  Part of a 30-day build-in-public challenge
